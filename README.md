# PropertyHandler
##### PropertyHandler is a simple way to read and write property files in Java.
## Why should I use it?
Managing property files in Java can become a hassle quickly: code can become messy and you have to deal with numerous exceptions.
With PropertyHandler you can avoid this smoothly: just get or set your property from your desired file, that's it.

## How can I use it?
The best way is to look at the javadoc documentation [here](https://kyrtap5.github.io/property-handler/index.html).
